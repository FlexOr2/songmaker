"""The mirror installer, driven as a real subprocess.

Two crashes shipped in this script because nothing ever ran it: `bash -n`
sees neither an unset variable at runtime nor a missing parent directory.
So this drives the real file, from a throwaway checkout, with `sudo`,
`systemctl` and `getent` replaced by fakes on PATH — no real units, no root,
nothing outside the temporary directories.

# Earlier versions of this file exec'd what they were asked to run, behind a
# growing wall of allowlists, and one of them rebooted the operator's machine.
# Every round of hardening found the next way through — `install -tDIR SRC`,
# `install -d OUT IN`, `--strip-program=/usr/bin/id`, a glob in an ExecStart
# that expands after the check, a shebang in an otherwise contained script.
# That is not a series of bugs; a shell stand-in that executes cannot be
# contained, because containing it means reimplementing the argument grammar
# of every program it might start.
#
# So there is one rule, and it is structural rather than enumerated: no branch
# of either fake starts a program. Everything below is a bash builtin. The one
# effect they still have — `install` putting a file where the installer put it
# — is a builtin read and a redirect, and only into a path that is textually
# under the sandbox, contains no `..`, and is not itself a symlink.
