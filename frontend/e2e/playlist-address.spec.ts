// A playlist's own address, driven the way the operator described it: paste
// it into a tab that knows nothing else and see the playlist (issue #286),
// the last new address of #265's chain -- same shape as an album's own
// (album-address.spec.ts), but a playlist has no album to nest inside, so its
// address is a sibling of `/`, not a segment under it.
//
// This is a path jsdom structurally cannot see, same reasoning as
// album-address.spec.ts: SvelteKit reconciles its mounted route tree only in
// a real browser, so only here does it show whether opening `/playlist/<slug>`
// mounts LibraryWorkspace inside the `(library)` route group (issue #276)
// rather than a route file of its own. That the app writes this address when
// a playlist opens is pinned in the unit suite (stores/navigation.test.ts),
// which costs the stack nothing.
